        <h3>The beautiful simplicity and powerfulness of feedforward Neural Networks</h3>
        <p>
            I haven't been working on this website, posting anything, or really updating it due to my obsession with the topic of deeplearning. Deeplearning is a whole
            can of worms onto itself, but for simplicity sakes, we'll simply refer to it as Neural Networks.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are many types of Neural Networks that are geared towards one specific type of task, but in this post, we'll talk about feedforward Neural Networks.
        </p>

        <h2>"A Neural network? Like.. the brain?"</h2>
        <p>
            Neural Networks are loosely inspired by our own biological Neural Networks as humans. These are the fundamental building blocks of how we as human beings learn and grow
            as a person. You might know the term 'Neural Networks' based on a pop-article explaining how ChatGPT worked on a surface level.
        </p>

        <p>
            Feedforward Neural Networks and biological Neural Networks have their differences and work in fundamentally different ways. So throwout your entire understanding of the human brain
            and learn about FFNNs (feedforward Neural Networks) as it's own entity.
        </p>
        <h2>Feedforward Neural networks</h2>
        <p>
            Feedforward Neural Networks are the defacto of machine learning, the process of training computers to learn from data and deal with unknown future input.
            A good example of this is spam-detection. Back then, (primarily in the 2000's) we had to use rule-based programs to detect and remove spam. This mean't detecting for
            common keywords such Spam emails would use such as 'FREE%%' or 'BUY 1 AND SELL 1' (phrase) and etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, as computers change, people change. And as people change, so does spam. These programs would quickly get very complicated as a byproduct of having to counter every
            spam email and edge case.
        </p>
        <p>
            Somewhere along the way, the industry found out you can use such FFNNS to not only train it on spam emails, but it can detect future spam emails (wih 98% accuracy) sometimes without even
            having to retrain it. These FFNNs were eventually the snowball which led to a variety of other use cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            These days, Feedforward Neural Networks are used for a variety of tasks including sentiment analysis, image classification (Although, convolutional Neural Networks have taken their place, seperate post for another time.),
            Some parts of video game NPCs, etc.
        </p>
        <h2>Mechanism of Feedforward Neural Networks</h2>
        <p>
            You might think that this technology requires satanic freemasonry black-magic from the dark-order in order to get right, but in reality, it's simply a bunch of addition and multiplication with a slice of calculus all chained together
            to get the 'intelligence' factor as a byproduct.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            Neural Networks can be divided into 3 parts:
        </p>
        <p>
            <div class="quote">
            - The Input Layer (Takes in Data) <br>
            - The Hidden Layer (Also known as the Thinking layer which transforms data) <br>
            - The output Layer (Spits out the Output) <br>
            </div>
        </p>

        <h3>Each individual Layer</h3>
        <p>
            Each layer has it's own respective purpose. The Input layer's job is to take in Data to be transformed before being sent into the Hidden Layer.
            The Input layer typically take's in vectors (also known as tensors) which look like this in format: {0, 0} depending on the network architecture.
            Each coefficent of the vector is split and sent into one Neuron (Again, sometimes a different process depending on Network architecture.)
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, if you 3 values in vector X, then there is usually 3 or more Neurons to receive this data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Hidden Layer will then receieve this data and transforms it (using Activation function, coming up). This newly transformed data is then sent into the OutputLayer
            which represents what the "conclusion" the HiddenLayer is 'thinking' of. For instance, if you're dealing with a spam network, and this information is being processed to the Hidden Layer,
            a trained network's hidden layer will process it and see it is spam, then it'll send the right signal to the OutputLayer indicating that it is indeed spam.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bottom line is:
        </p>
        <p>
            <div class="quote">
                Input Layer - Receives Data <br>
                Hidden Layer - Computes and derives conclusion from data <br>
                Output Layer - Represents conclusion of data from HiddenLayer <br>
            </div>
        </p>
        <h3>Weights and biases</h3>
        <p>
            I talk about how this data is 'transformed' and 'processed' before being sent into another layer. But, this is vague language, what does it actually mean?
            You see, each and every Neuron has a 'weight' and a 'bias' which is connected to another neuron typically in the next Layer. 'Weights and biases' are also referred to
            as the individual 'parameters' in the network, otherwise the arguments of how to transform data before being passed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <div class="quote">
                Weights - Numerical Strength connection between Neuron A and Neuron B <br>
                Bias - Offset to add to the activated value <br>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            Weights represent how 'strong' the connection between 2 Neurons are. This is done on purpose so that way when data is transformed, the neurons which have a 'strong' weight connection
            will have a higher activation sum, and therefore make the most amount of impact on the output. Weights are the foundamental building block to how Neural Networks learn and make the correct output.
            Whereas, a bias's job is to 'offset' the activation value by adding to it. Let's say the activation sum between 2 neurons is 0.4 and the bias is 0.1, well, adding to it, we'll get 0.5.
        </p>
        <p>
            Biases are typically used to slightly offset the output of a network without having to train it to it's absolute precise target output (Output we want the network to give us). This is we don't have to
            train the network to absolute perfection and risk overfitting (Training the network too much to the point where it misses the mark).
        </p>
        <h3>Activation sum</h3>
        <p>
            How are weights and biases added with respect to data before being sent into the next Layer? This is known as the activation sum, which looks like such:
        </p>
        <p>
            <div class="quote">
                y = f(y * w + b) <br>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            Where <i>y</i> is the output and <i>w</i> represents a single weight and <i>b</i> represents a single bias. The input is multiplied by our weight then adds the bias to it.
            This activation formula is stretched out for every single Neuron and input coefficent before being sent into the next layer.
        </p>
