            <h1>Pythagoras was right on π.</h1>
            <h2>Irrational numbers aren't actually numbers.</h2>

            <p>
                Your Algebra I textbooks are lying. Irrational numbers are NOT Numbers. They do not fit the criteria of a number and therefore should never be considered as such.
            </p>

            <h2>What a number is</h2>

            <p>
            This isn't some argument where I have to redefine terms to prove what I am saying, this make's sense even in the context of what's established in modern mathematics.
            Let's look closely at what a number is:

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number"><img src="../res/NumberDef.PNG"></a>
            </p>

            <p>
                Based on what we just read above, a number has these properties:

                - Can be measured to measure (And otherwise measureable on itself)
                - Can be used to count and label
                - Quantfiable
                - has a specific place on the numberline
            </p>

            <h2>Irrationals unmasked</h2>

            <p>
                So, let's take a irrational such as Φ (With a approximated value of 1.618033987). Is this a number? Well irrationals are considered irrational because their non-terminating. The actual value of
                phi never truly ends. The actual value of phi and any non-terminating value is: ∞.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hopefully you're getting at what I'm trying to explain. Infinity is certainly not a number and fits no part of the criteria we just learned about. It isn't measurable,
                quantifiable, or can be used to count. And, it certainly doesn't have a static place on the numberline. That is my argument in a nutshell.
            </p>

            <h2>"But, what about the approximation?"</h2>

            <p>
                If Irrationals aren't numbers to begin with, how did we get their approximation? Introducing, the R set!
