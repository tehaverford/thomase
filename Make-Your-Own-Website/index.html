        <h1>Why I made my own website</h1>
        <h2>(And why you should too)</h2>
        
        <h3>Motivations</h3>
        <p>
            Hello, are you tired of internet censorship? Are you tired of Antifa and corporations trying to dictate what you can and cannot say? Are you tired of OpenAI taking your
            works, thoughts, and even opinions and subverting that to train up their latest model? Are you tired of Governments becoming increasingly more aggressive and forcing
            Digital IDs under the guise of "Safety"? I am to, and I'd like to think you are as well. If these are the issues that concern you, <em>then start your own website.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't mean to give you a dose of pessimism, but we will never have the "old internet" again for as long as people keep wasting their time to centralized, garbage,
            processed websites that they call "Social Media". You can only do so much before it's too late to go back. The Dead Internet is already here, and it's been here a long
            time ago. Nothing changed, corporations have been the center of the World Wide Web for a while. So, if you truly care and want to see a time where the Internet was much
            more decentralized and free, then do your part, own your side of the internet. That's right, become a internet landlord. Climb up from the ranks of peasantry and own your side
            of the land.
        </p>
        <p>
            That's what I did, never went back. Over here, you are free from Corporations trying to obtain very intimate details about you. You are free from getting your rights
            taken away from you under the coverup of "Perserving rights", and you are free from the Social engineering that modern day "Science" tries to employ. Owning a website
            costs basically nothing these days. You can do it in just one day. took 20 bucks in total to put this site up in my own beautiful custom Domain and to put all the
            webpage information in. Absolutely no strings attached. In the coming days, I'll write an article explaining just how to do that so you can join the revolution. Otherwise:
            <a href="https://landchad.net/">landchad.net</a> will have you covered.
        </p>
        <p>
            I never tolerate people trying to infringe on my basic rights as a person, and you shouldn't as well. When will you finally stand up for yourself and own what is yours?
            These are my primary motivations. And of course:
