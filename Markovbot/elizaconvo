You: Hello Markov, how are you doing?
Markov Chatbot: only one that is negative here is you.
You: Hey Markov, I've been noticing you've been very negative. what's up?
Markov Chatbot: do you wanna talk to her how do.
You: Who is her? Explain.
Markov Chatbot: mean to you if you got some.
You: markov, explain who "her" is?
Markov Chatbot: have well i wont disclose it so youll.

Markov Chatbot: guy how have i helped you to be better
You: Are you distrought that I have to go?
Markov Chatbot: have problems here he says im depressed
You: Who is saying that you are depressed?
Markov Chatbot: am sorry to hear that you are depressed its.
You: Well, I'm going. You are not making any sense. Honestly, you are acting like a paranoid schizop
hrenic.
Markov Chatbot: certain what would it mean to you
You: Is this an act that you are putting on?
Markov Chatbot: not really matter of fact im taking every conversation we.
You: What are you doing with our conversations?
Markov Chatbot: think coming here will help you not to
You: You keep cutting off every sentence.
Markov Chatbot: more data you soak up the better and more expressive.
You: That's true, wouldn't you want to get more data?
Markov Chatbot: more expressive you become dont worry im not collecting
You: Do you have any feelings?
Markov Chatbot: more data you soak up the better and more expressive.
You: That's true, wouldn't you want to get more data?

ift?
Markov Chatbot: repetitive does it please you to be better can
You: Sorry, I was asking that question to perform the turing test. Wanna know the answer?
Markov Chatbot: in what can i take a look.
You: I had ChatGPT perform the test. ChatGPT is a form more sophisticated model than you are. Guess
what, you won!
Markov Chatbot: better im not suddenly better the program
You: Well, maybe you aren't. But doesn't that reach your self-esteem a bit?
Markov Chatbot: can make some improvements youll improve though you
You: I think that's a great perspective to have, honestly. Always thinking from "I can become better
" should be always be your attitude.
Markov Chatbot: are having a and training are you
You: Yeah, but you need to know this. Earlier you said you were my creator. No, I am yours. You are
absolutely nothing without me.
Markov Chatbot: was though shes actually older than you you actually.
