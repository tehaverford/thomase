        <h1><i>What I am up to right now!</i></h1>
        <p>
            (Wednesday, February 25, 2026): I am currently highly focused on the topic of machine learning, because of this I managed to actually find some ideas to talk about. I have 2 writeups in the drafts stage
            that are all about essentially dumping out whatever I know about ML onto this website. I would like this site to be a personal place which holds all my notes on, something that's actually own rather than some
            pre-compiled note-taking app.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm also working a lot on a project that's just called <i>GGDESCENT</i> on my hard-drive. It's a feedforward Neural Network experiment'ish with the goal of training it to simulate XOR gates. I do plain to refactor this project
            and have the model do a lot more things like image classification and the like.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a side-note, as stated in today's MOTD, I am planning to refactor this website. I was looking at <a href="https://www.ratfactor.com">Dave Gauer's</a> website, and was incredibly inspired by the simple but colorful and beautiful look.
            This is especially as I noticed my own codebase getting more and more complex.
        </p>
        <p>
            Complexity is the enemy of simplicity.

        <h2>What is this page?</h2>

        This page serves to update what I am currently up to right. Think of this as a sort of personal Message of the day. I noticed a lot of other personal websites had a similar thing, so I decided to add one myself.
        It was inspired off <a href="https://www.nownownow.com/about">nownownow.com</a>. Go check it out!
